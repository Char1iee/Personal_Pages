### A Programmer

Hello! I'm **Charlie Shang**, a third year CS undergrad stuyding at UCSD. My programming experience includes multiple languages, such as python, Java, C, and C++. I completed my first CS project in a summer camp at Tufts University during high school, which is a game demo built by pygame. This experience made me more determined to major in this field and learn more foundational and advanced knowledge about CS. Currently I am one of the undergrad members of cyberlab under SEElab and working on adversarial attacks on machine-learning-based intrusion detection, which applies AI on intrusion detection system to prevent cyber attacks. I am very interested in becoming a researcher and even PHD in the future, and my research interest lies in the application of AI in different domains. I enjoy coding for most times, especailly the process of debugging, because I love the feeling of success when I fix all bugs and everything works out. One important thing I need to improve is to write more comments. I usually trusted my memory too much which led to problems that I could avoid.

### A Person

There exists a few stereotypes about not only CS but also science and engineering people, such as that we are poor communicators, we are antisocial, we have limited interests... I would like to break those stereotypes. I really love to communicate with other people, because getting to know more interesting people is one of the joy in my life. My favorite sports is skiing. I have skiied a few times near LA after coming to US, and I think my next trip will be at Tahoe probably next winter break. Last but not least, I love cats, and I own a pair of brother and sister Siberian cats. The younger sister is the one sitting on my legs in the picture. They are the spice of my life.
